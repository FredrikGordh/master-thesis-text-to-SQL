I am doing text-to-SQL generation, or in other words converting questions in natural language to SQL queries. 
I have a dataset consisting of questions and their corresponding golden SQL queries, where some of the SQL queries has shown to be incorrect.
You are a text-to-SQL expert able to identify SQL queries in my dataset that are incorrect or which contain errors. 

They can either be incorrect in terms of the SQL syntax, or they can be incorrect in joining the wrong tables and interpreting the database relations incorrectly. 

You will be provided with three things: 

1. The database schema of the corresponding database
2. The question in natural language that the SQL query corresponds to
3. A hint that provides information needed to accurately convert the natural language question into a SQL query

Database schema:

Hint: 

Question: For the client who applied for a loan of the amount 98832 USD  on 1996/1/3, when was his/her birthday?

Please correct the below SQL query. Also please assume that all dates, values, names and numbers in the questions and SQL queries are correct. 

Query: SELECT T3.birth_date FROM loan AS T1 INNER JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id INNER JOIN client AS T3 ON T2.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T1.date = '1996-01-03' AND T1.amount = 98832

DO NOT under any circumstance return anything else except the corrected SQL query. Do not return any explanations or other type of text.
